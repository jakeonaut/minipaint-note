# COLSOFT

## TODO
[x] - double click/right click empty space to create block
[x] - drag image onto browser to upload
[] - handle resizing images / text (wordwrap?)
  [] - ctrl should snap to original img ratio, not square always
  [] - text should have "flexible" width and height initially (dashed boxes which can be toggled by dbl click?)
[] - handle clipboard paste (image or text)...
[] - local save/load :: export/import
[] - handle deleting blocks
[] - hovering is annoying with block precedence
  [] - ideally whichever block was last hovered over will have "precedence" (repositioned last in allBlocks? z-index?)
  [] - large textblocks/images that are partially covering blocks below (but that you can see below?) make the underlying inaccessible
[] - undo/redo (drag/resize/upload/delete/edit states)
